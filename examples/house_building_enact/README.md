This is a "sitauted" version of the classical house_built example enhanced with an _enactment engine_, which produces effects of institutional facts.

The enactment specification is available at [src/org/house.enact](src/org/house.enact).

In this example, the enactment effects are log messages such as below:
```
[enact_listener] enact: [mail(companyE,"You have been hired as roofer.")]
[enact_listener] enact: [mail(companyC5,"You have been hired as window fitter.")]
[enact_listener] enact: [mail(companyC5,"You have been hired as door fitter.")]
[enact_listener] enact: [mail(companyA,"You have been hired as plumber.")]
[enact_listener] enact: [mail(companyC4,"You have been hired as window electrician.")]
[enact_listener] enact: [mail(companyC5,"You have been hired as painter.")]
```
